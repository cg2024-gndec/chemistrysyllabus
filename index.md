## Part-A
### Unit-1 Water chemistry: 

[Introduction, hardness of water (its units, its types, its determination by EDTA 
method using normality equation). Softening of water by lime-soda method, 
ion-exchange method and zeolite method. Boiler feed water: - causes, 
disadvantages, preven on and removal of -scale and sludge formation, 
priming, foaming, caustic embrittlement and boiler corrosion. Different steps 
for water purification to make it fit for drinking: - sedimentation, filtration, 
flocculation, sterilization (using chlorine, bleaching powder, chloramines, 
ozone & UV rays). Desalination of brackish water by electrodialysis and reverse 
osmosis.](https://cg2024-gndec.github.io/chemnotes/#water-treatment)

###  Unit-3 Electrochemistry: 

[Fundamentals of electrochemistry: - electrode, electrodepotential, 
electrochemical series, electrochemical cell, its representation. Nernst 
equation and applications, numerical based on Nernst equation. Different type 
of electrodes: - gas, calomel, quinhydrone electrode. Fuel cell. Solar cell. Li ion 
battery and EV battery](https://cg2024-gndec.github.io/chemnotes/#electrochemistry)
